  - atarisio: Added support for linux 2.6.x kernel
  - atarisio: Added module parameter to set name of serial device
    (instead of old io/irq numbers) - making the 'pre install'
    and 'post remove' setserial stuff (partially) obsolete.
  - atariserver: Added preliminary support for ATP 1.6 images
  - Added new userspace tools:
    * atr2atp converts an SD or ED ATR/DCM/DI/XFD image into the ATP format
    * atpdump dumps the internal structure of an ATP image
    * adir prints the directory of an ATR/DCM/DI/XFD image
  - Reworked large parts of the user space code

    fix compatibility problems with some slow high-speed-SIO routines

    MyDos now works correctly
  - atarixfer: Added support for reading non-standard sized disks
  - atarixfer: Implemented XF551-compatible format recognition
  - atarixfer: Added support for writing quad-density disks
  - atarisio: Speedy 1050 workaround in 1050-2-PC/ProSystem mode.
    'ACK' instead of 'COMPLETE' is now allowed, too
  - atarisio: debugging level can now be set using module parameters
    'debug' and 'debug_irq'

  - atarixfer: fixed writing of ED (130k) and QD (360k) images
  - atarisio: removed modversions.h include for 2.6.x kernels

  - atariserver: added "virtual drive" functionality to transparently
    access files on the PC
  - atariserver: implemented search path for loading disk images
  - atariserver: added special "load MyPicoDos" (BIN/BAS/COM file
    loader) command 0x6d
  - atariserver: virtual drives now contain boot code to load MyPicoDos
    from atariserver
  - atariserver: implemented printer support
  - atarisio: the case when the PC was too slow to react on received bytes
    and more bytes than expected were received is now handled correctly
  - atarisio: increased delay between command ACK and complete to
    fix problems with QMEG OS
  - dir2atr: added optional boot-sectors for Dos 2.0, 2.5, TurboDos2.1
    and MyPicoDos (4.03 and 4.04)

    with an unrecognized extension

    (command $54, 6 bytes data, identical to "apetime")
  - atariserver: new "pl" - "print log entry" command to display
    some text in the atariserver log window
  - atariserver: support for proprietary "get image name" and
    "get APE version" APE commands in disk handler

    without unloading the image or printer-handler
  - atarisio: fixed kernel driver for AMD64 (thanks to B. Watson)
  - changed the boot code of ATR-images that were created on the
    fly (when loading a file with an unknown extension) so that
    MyPicoDos autoruns the file in the image.
  - atarisio: added support for kernel >=2.6.19
  - added "allclean" target to clean 6502 binary files, running
    "make clean" doesn't remove them (so people without ATasm don't
    run into troubles)
  - atarisio: support for autoswitching Atarimax interface
  - atarisio: fixed module usage count for kernel 2.6.x
  - dir2atr: automatically include PICODOS.SYS when creating a
