About Atarisio
==============

AtariSIO basically consists of two parts:
- a kernel module to handle the low-level part of the Atari SIO
  protocol, and
- a set of utilities (atarserver emulates Atari floppy disk
  drives, atarixfer can read/write floppy disks from/to a
  floppy drive connected to the PC)
- a set of utilities to handle ATR (and other) disk images
  (adir to list the directory of an image and dir2atr to
  create a disk image from a directory of files on your PC)
